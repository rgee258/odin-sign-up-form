# Odin Sign Up Form

Here you'll find a mock up of a sign up page for a vinyl collecting service known as Vinyl Haven. As a result, the submission button and log in link both do not lead anywhere. The last name input simulates an input put into focus, while the passwords are indicative of errors respectively. The validation messages apparent are added directly as html elements without any Javascript, otherwise they would appear as one would expect if Javascript was used. As the Odin Project continues to expand and be revised, this is one of the projects I completed that was not required before. Doing this was not only a great way to practice barebones HTML and CSS with a return to the fundamentals, but also a method for me to incorporate aspects of CSS I generally glossed over previously.
